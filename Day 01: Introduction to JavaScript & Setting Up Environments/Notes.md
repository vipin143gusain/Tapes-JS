Here are some important interview questions with simple answers, based on the JavaScript introduction video:

### JavaScript Fundamentals

1.  **Question:** What is JavaScript in simple terms?
    * **Answer:** JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive. Think of it as the "action" part of a website â€“ it makes buttons clickable, shows animations, updates content without reloading the page, and lets you do cool things like play games directly in your browser. It's also used to build other things like mobile apps and server programs.

2.  **Question:** What are the basic tools you need to write and run JavaScript code?
    * **Answer:** You mainly need three things:
        * **A code editor:** Like VS Code, where you write your JavaScript code.
        * **A web browser:** Like Chrome, which has a built-in "console" (a special area) where you can test and see your JavaScript code running.
        * **Node.js:** This is software that lets you run JavaScript outside of a web browser, like on a server for more complex applications.

### Including JavaScript in HTML

3.  **Question:** What are the different ways to add JavaScript code to an HTML page?
    * **Answer:** There are a few main ways:
        * **Inline Script:** You can write JavaScript directly inside `<script>` tags within your HTML file. This is usually for very small, specific tasks.
            ```html
            <button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click me</button>
            ```
            (Note: While `onclick` is inline, the video also shows `<script>alert('Hello!');</script>` directly in the HTML)
        * **Internal Script:** You put your JavaScript code inside `<script>` tags anywhere in your HTML file, like in the `<head>` or `<body>`.
            ```html
            <script>
              console.log("Hello from internal script!");
            </script>
            ```
        * **External Script:** This is the most common and best practice. You write your JavaScript code in a separate `.js` file (e.g., `script.js`) and then link it to your HTML file using the `<script src="script.js"></script>` tag.

4.  **Question:** Why is it often recommended to place `<script>` tags (for external JavaScript files) just before the closing `</body>` tag in HTML?
    * **Answer:** When a browser loads an HTML page, it reads it from top to bottom. If JavaScript is placed in the `<head>` and tries to change something in the HTML (like a button or a paragraph) that hasn't loaded yet, it will cause an error. Placing the script at the end of the `<body>` ensures that all the HTML content and elements are fully loaded and ready before JavaScript tries to work with them, preventing errors and making the page appear faster to the user.

### Script Loading Attributes

5.  **Question:** Explain the difference between `async` and `defer` attributes when loading external JavaScript files.
    * **Answer:** Both `async` and `defer` help load JavaScript files without blocking the main HTML content, but they execute differently:
        * **`async`:** The script downloads *while* the HTML is being parsed. As soon as it's downloaded, HTML parsing stops, the script runs, and then HTML parsing continues. It's good for independent scripts that don't rely on the HTML structure or other scripts (like analytics trackers).
        * **`defer`:** The script also downloads *while* the HTML is being parsed. However, it waits until the *entire* HTML document has been parsed and the page structure is ready before it runs. All deferred scripts run in the order they appear in the HTML. This is generally recommended for scripts that interact with your webpage's elements.

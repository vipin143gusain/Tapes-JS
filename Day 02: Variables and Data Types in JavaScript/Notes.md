Here are some important interview questions and answers based on the video, explained in a simple and easy way:

### Variables and Data Types

1.  **Question:** How do you create or define a variable in JavaScript?
    **Answer:** You use keywords like `var`, `let`, or `const` followed by the variable name and then assign a value to it. For example, `let name = "John";` or `const age = 30;`.

2.  **Question:** What are the two main types of data in JavaScript?
    **Answer:** JavaScript has two main types of data:
    * **Primitive Types:** These are simple data types like numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, and `undefined`.
    * **Non-Primitive (or Reference) Types:** These are more complex data types like objects, arrays, and functions.

3.  **Question:** What does "pass by value" mean in JavaScript, especially for primitive types?
    **Answer:** When you "pass by value," you are essentially passing a *copy* of the actual value. If you change the copy, the original value remains unchanged. This usually applies to primitive data types.

### Variable Declaration Keywords (`var`, `let`, `const`)

4.  **Question:** What are `var`, `let`, and `const`, and what's the main difference between them?
    **Answer:** These are keywords used to declare variables in JavaScript:
    * **`var`**: Oldest way. Variables declared with `var` can be re-declared and re-assigned within their scope. They have function scope, meaning they are available throughout the function they are declared in.
    * **`let`**: Introduced in ES6. Variables declared with `let` can be re-assigned but *not* re-declared within the same scope. They have block scope, meaning they are only available within the block (like an `if` statement or `for` loop) they are declared in.
    * **`const`**: Also introduced in ES6. Variables declared with `const` cannot be re-assigned *or* re-declared after their initial assignment. They also have block scope. You should use `const` when a variable's value will not change.

### Variable Naming Rules

5.  **Question:** What are some important rules for naming variables in JavaScript?
    **Answer:**
    * Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), and dollar signs (`$`).
    * They *cannot* start with a number.
    * They are case-sensitive (e.g., `myVariable` is different from `myvariable`).
    * You cannot use JavaScript reserved keywords (like `if`, `for`, `function`, `let`, `const`, `var`) as variable names.

### Comments

6.  **Question:** How do you add comments in JavaScript code?
    **Answer:** You can add comments to explain your code without it affecting the program's execution:
    * **Single-line comments:** Start with two forward slashes `//`.
    * **Multi-line comments:** Start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

### `undefined` vs. `null`

7.  **Question:** What is the difference between `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript?
    **Answer:**
    * **`undefined`**: This means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet. It's the default value for uninitialized variables.
    * **`null`**: This is an assignment value, meaning it explicitly represents "no value" or "empty." It's a deliberate choice by the programmer.

### Data Storage

8.  **Question:** How are data types stored in memory (Stack and Heap)?
    **Answer:**
    * **Stack:** Primitive data types (like numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, `undefined`) are stored directly on the stack. The stack is used for static memory allocation where the size of the data is known at compile time.
    * **Heap:** Non-primitive (reference) data types (like objects, arrays, functions) are stored on the heap. The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation, and variables on the stack store a *reference* (memory address) to the actual data on the heap.

### JavaScript Engine Execution

9.  **Question:** What are the main phases a JavaScript engine goes through when running code?
    **Answer:** The JavaScript engine goes through three main phases:
    * **Tokenizing:** The code is broken down into small units called tokens (like keywords, identifiers, operators).
    * **Parsing:** The tokens are arranged into a tree-like structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), checking for syntax errors.
    * **Interpreting/Execution:** The engine then translates and executes the code based on the AST.
